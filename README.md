## usage:

# post folder
to create a post, create a folder with a number value
start with 0 and increment

ex:

posts/0 (first post, will appear in the end of the site)
posts/1 (second post)
posts/2
posts/3
posts/4 (will appear as last post)

# folder format:
posts/0
|-> content.html (REQUIRED)
|-> anything you want
v

all posts are html pages so you have full freedom to do whatever you want.
